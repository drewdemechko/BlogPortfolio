		<h2>Intro</h2>
		Hello! My name is Drew Demechko. I am currently a Junior attending the University of Central Oklahoma.
		My expected graduation date is December 2016. I will graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration.

		<h2>When Did I First Gain Interest In Technology, More Specifically Programming?</h2>
		I first developed a passion for software development in junior high.
		Like most kids my age, I spent most of my free time playing video games.
		This one game in particular, a very popular MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role-playing game).
		This game would take up most of my nights and weekends. I played religiously with four of my closest friends.
		<br><br>
		A theme that the four of us shared was that we wanted to have the best character.
		To have the best character one would have to play more hours than the others did in order to gain more money and strengthen their skills.
		There was only one problem. My parents believed in building a strong work ethic at a young age, so I had to get a part-time job (about 30 hours a week) even though 
		I was also going to school from 8:00AM - 2:00PM Monday through Friday.
		It was going to be near impossible for me to reach the title of the best out of the group with the amount of free time that I had.
		<br><br>
		Somehow I had to find a way to "buy time". After some exhaustive research online I learned that people were able to earn money
		and strengthen their skills on this game without being at the computer. They did this by creating a bot.
		I knew that this was going to be my edge! I had to find out what a bot was and how to create one.
		I came to find out that a bot was a script that ran through an infinite loop.
		<br><br>
		The language that was used for this type of scripting was called Simba.
		As long as I knew the reoccurring tasks that this certain method of making money or training my skill involved I could
		tell the script how to do the first ten minutes of it. The script would then just loop over and over until I got home from work or school.
		To create the scripts in Simba I had to learn the syntax of the language and some basic programming fundamentals.
		Even though I used programming to make a video game easier I came to find out that programming was used to simplify tasks that were performed on a daily basis.
		<br><br>
		<h2>What Helped Turn My Interest Into A Hobby and Passion?</h2>
		After my interest for video games ran out, my interest for programming stayed afloat.
		Even though I did not spend every hour programming (I wish I could go back in time), my electives consisted of the two programming classes that my school offered.
		In my Sophomore year of high-school I was given a great opportunity that would change my life forever.
		<br><br>
		One day representatives from a near by technical school, Moore Norman Technology Center came to visit my high-school.
		The representatives were there to give perspective students an opportunity to start or explore a career path. 
		The representatives explained that all students that were either at the junior or senior level and were on pace to graduate
		with the appropriate general education classes could obtain their electives by going to Moore Norman Technology Center for
		half of the day and returning to high school for the latter half of the day to finish their general education courses.
		Certifications of completion were given out after two years in the program, which made a soon to be Junior, like myself, a perfect
		candidate.
		<br><br>
		I will be completely honest with you guys. I did not find school interesting and thought my time could be spent better elsewhere.
		Due to this mentality my grades were very low, even though I did not Fail classes, I did just enough to get by.
		Even if I wanted to enroll in a program at Moore Norman I knew that I had a low chance of getting in based on my low grades.
		Due to my interest being peaked slightly, I attended an info session that the representatives held.
		I think the real reason that I attended this session was to get out of class for an hour.
		However, I am thankful that I attended and more importantly, that my high-school entered an agreement with Moore Norman.
		<br><br>
		During the info session the representatives shared a brochure with the students that listed everything that could be gained
		from a program at Moore Norman. The brochure also listed the courses that were offered at the school.
		After skimming through the brochure, a course that the school offered caught my eye.
		The course was titled "Programming". I knew exactly what this class was and my interest in the program grew from a might-attend to a must-attend!
		I researched the term programming extensively and found all of the jobs that I could get by knowing this trade (it just seems to be one of fastest growing marketable skill for employers).
		For a few days I got caught up in all of my research and completely forgot about my grades.
		There was no way that I could get in this program with my track record but I was taught at a very young age
		to pursue my interests and not to give up. 
		<br><br>
		I knew it was a long shot but I decided to apply for the Programming course offered at Moore Norman.
		The application process consisted of each prospective student talking with a counsellor, the review of a high-school transcript, and an interview.
		After those three steps, to my surprise, I got accepted! Now that I look back on my past, I figure that I probably got in the program due 
		to the small pool of high-school students that found the topic of programming interesting.
		Although, with all four high-schools in the area, the classroom size was pretty decent (about 20 students).
		<br><br>
		As I stated above, the course was about four hours a day at a nearby campus. I learned the fundamentals of programming and documentation 
		through the course and developed a strong passion for software development. With the program coming to a close, I was back at square one, "what next"?
		Since I found programming to be more of a hobby than a gruelling tedious task, I decided to research my options of careers in this discipline.
		I found that jobs were definitely obtainable without a degree but it seemed to be much harder to
		work your way up in management or earn competitive salaries in the long run. I decided that college was the next chapter in my book and that it would provide the best
		opportunity for my future dreams and aspirations. The career that I found most interesting and rewarding associated with this skill was
		a software developer or software engineer. With Software development/engineering not being around as long as other careers such as teaching or business, it seemed
		like there were not many programs offered in this discipline at universities. 
		<br><br>
		<img id="aboutmepic2" src="AboutMePicture2.jpeg"/>
		I did end up visiting some schools that did offer a Software Engineering program at their university. At the time
		not one university in Oklahoma offered the degree. After weighing my financial situation and taking my Grade point average in consideration,
		it was simply not an option for me to obtain a degree in Software Engineering. Was my search at an end? Would I ever be able to be a Software
		Engineer or should I just switch my entire career path?
		Thankfully, there is a similar program offered at most universities under the title "Computer Science".
		In my opinion Computer Science is more of a survey course for students that are interested in technology and what they can do with it.
		After reviewing all of the perks at the three universities around my area (Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, and University of Central Oklahoma)
		I decided that the courses offered at the University of Central Oklahoma would be the best option.
		<br><br>
		<h2>Gaining an Edge Over Others</h2>
		I knew that the degree in Computer Science at a school that wasn't really known for producing high quality Software Engineers wouldn't give me all of the skills necessary to compete
		in this very competitive industry. I had to separate myself from the pack. The question became "How do I separate myself from every other kid that has a degree in Computer Science"?
		The answer was a simple one, through an internship. The path in actually getting an internship wasn't as easy. My passion at an early age with the combination of 
		attending Moore Norman Technology Center for Computer Programming definitely helped as well as a holding a 3.45 grade point average and various projects outside of the classroom.
		<br><br>
		The search for internships started my Sophomore year. I had to use external sources such as job boards and events through the University to find them.
		I came across about seven internships that I was at least somewhat interested in and eligible for that were located in Oklahoma.
		Out of the seven that I applied for there was one that I knew was yet another long shot just like enrolling for Moore Norman was but a voice in my head told me to keep pursuing that option relentlessly
		and not to give up. The internship was from one of the top technology companies you will find in Oklahoma, Seagate Technology.
		I applied in November and got offered the internship at Seagate in February 2015!
		The internship was a Systems Analyst internship that would last from May 2015 - August 2015.
		Although a Systems Analyst wasn't my end goal, I could not pass on this opportunity.
		I knew that Seagate was a respectable name in the industry and that the amount of knowledge and connections that could be gained from
		this opportunity were priceless. Out of the offers that I received, Seagate seemed like the clear choice.
		I am extremely blessed for the opportunity and owe a lot to the company for believing in me.
		<br><br>
		<h2>Where Am I Now and What is the Next Step?</h2>
		After my internship concluded at Seagate I knew that the next steps would be very important as far as
		it pertains to my future. I am expected to graduate in December 2016, which leaves me with three very crucial semesters in order to reach my dream of 
		becoming a Software Developer/Engineer.
		I know that internships are a dime a dozen and not all students get the opportunity to have one internship, let alone multiple.
		Although it will be tough to get an internship for all of my remaining semesters, 
		I need to try in order to reach all of my future goals. If I am able to complete this task I believe that the possibilities are endless.
		<br><br>
		The remaining internships are very important. The way that my mindset is, I will not settle for anything that does not
		benefit my end goal of becoming a Software Developer/Engineer. I have noticed that Fall and Spring internships seem to be far less common compared to the Summer.
		The exciting thing is that there are Software Engineering Internships available within distance of my school! Unfortunately, there are only three internships that seem to be 
		true "Software Engineering" and that I believe would benefit my future more than outside projects.
		<br><br>
		<img id="aboutmepic3" src="AboutMePicture3.jpg"/>
		I was excited to get an opportunity to interview for all three of these companies. Out of the three there were two that I could see myself working at for years to come.
		Both internships were at mid-sized companies, which means that the internship would more than likely include
		tasks that a full-time employee also performed but at a fraction of the cost. This was a huge plus for me because I want to learn as much as I can.
		After all that is what an internship is really for right?
		<br><br>
		<h2>As of 2016</h2>
		I have heard back from the internships that I have applied for and had a few offers on the table.
		However, after carefully reviewing all of my offers, two came in really competitively and had amazing perks to offer.
		The perk that had the most significance on me at this point in time was a great culture, which both had. I 
		feel like I could gain a lot of knowledge at both companies. Ultimately I decided to go with American Fidelity Assurance 
		where I am currently employed as a Software Developer/Engineer intern in the ISD department. I am excited to become part of this team
		and I am really looking forward to see what the future holds.<br><br>
