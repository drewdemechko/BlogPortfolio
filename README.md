# BlogPortfolio
Technologies Used: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and XAMPP 

This project is a website that lets its administrator showcase their projects and publish their thoughts through writing personal and professional blog entries.

The website is not powered by WordPress or any other content management system that allows a developer to add the type of functionality that this site includes with little or no knowledge of programming. All the functionality included on this project was developed from scratch and written from start to finish. If it was done in a professional setting a content management system like WordPress or Drupal might have been used depending on the requirements of the application.
